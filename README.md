# French-Open-domain-Chatbot

As we know, the majority of open-domain chatbots today primarily work in the English language, but are not able to speak other languages. 
Here We want to create a chatbot that is capable of speaking French. 

For that, we will try several approaches:
Training models from scratch on native French data.
Fine-tuning an English chatbot on French data
Fine-tune mBart on chat data, in order to teach it to be a French speaking Chatbot
Using machine translation to translate existing English datasets to French, and retraining/fine-tuning.
